# South Broward Football Stats Dashboard

A Streamlit dashboard that displays season and weekly football statistics for the South Broward High School football program. Built to give players a way to track their own performance and to support MaxPreps submissions for recruiting visibility.

## How It Works

The dashboard reads from `season_summary.csv`, which is generated by a SQL aggregation view on the backend and exported to S3. The CSV contains per player stats rolled up by week and cumulative season totals.

The dashboard does not connect directly to the database. This was an intentional design decision — a public facing app has no business connecting to an RDS instance sitting in a private subnet.
